# Link-Namer
Jupyter Notebook to take hypertext links in a .txt file and give their corresponding names in a .xls  file

I have a habit of hoarding links to websites and tutorials. It is tedious to save the context of the links at the same time, so I save my links to a .txt file, with each link in a new line and then pass it though this Notebook. The links and their corresponding titles are saved in an Excel file. I mostly use it for Youtube video tutorials.
